# [My Resume](https://github.com/keshihua5/resume/blob/master/images/Cloud%2C%20Robert.pdf)   
I ‒ love technology, research, writing, and words. I'm a "communicator" with extensive domestic/international experience researching, writing, editing, proofreading, and designing technical and non-technical documentation.

Recently moved to Seattle from Beijing, China (where I've lived/worked for 14.5 years). 
Worked 12.5 years as a Senior Technical Writer for Oracle Systems R&D Center, Beijing, and two years as a College/University English instructor.

Living and working in China was a fantastic experience for me. Not only learned a lot about the culture, but professionally-speaking, my communication skills have greatly improved;  I speak fluent Mandarin Chinese.
